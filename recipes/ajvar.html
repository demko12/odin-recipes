<p class="ajvar-paragraph">Ajvar is a condiment made principally from sweet bell peppers and eggplants. The relish
    became a popular side dish
    throughout Yugoslavia after World War II and is popular in Southeast Europe.
    Homemade ajvar is made of roasted peppers. Depending on the capsaicin content in bell peppers and the amount of
    added chili peppers, it can be sweet (traditional), piquant (the most common), or very hot. Ajvar can be consumed as
    a bread spread or as a side dish. <br> <br>

    <p style="text-align:center;">Steps on making ajvar:</p>

    <ol style="list-style:none;">
        <li>Preheat your oven to 240°C (470°F)</li>
        <li>Cut the eggplant into large pieces and arrange on the baking tray</li>
        <li>Cut the red peppers into halves and arrange them on the baking tray</li>
        <li>Cook in the oven for around half an hour, ensuring that the peppers <br>
            have gone a rather attractive shade of black!</li>
        <li>Take the eggplant and peppers from the tray and place them into a <br>
            large bowl. Cover the bowl and set aside for around 20
            minutes</li>
        <li>Peel the peppers, remove the core and the seeds – again, you don’t <br>
            need these bits, toss them</li>
    </ol>
